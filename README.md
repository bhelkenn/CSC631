# CSC631

Tested code and it works as designed. Added 3 new things:
1) scaling effect on animals that doubles them over the course of 60 seconds, starting when they instantiate.
2) scoreboards along the top that tracks “dummy” (initial start animals) and animal1, 2, 3 counts.
3) Added a perpetual rain effect with some rain drop burst effects.
